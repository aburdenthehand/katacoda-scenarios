Live Migration is a common virtualization feature supported by KubeVirt where
virtual machines running on one cluster node move to another cluster node
without shutting down the guest OS or its applications.

This scenario demonstrates how to migrate a VM from one node to another in a KubeVirt cluster.

For more information, see the [KubeVirt Project's Live Migration Lab](https://kubevirt.io/labs/kubernetes/migration.html)
